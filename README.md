* Assignment 01 - Single Server Queue 

### What is this repository for? ###
Assignment 01 Instructions:
* Assuming that a machine shop is modeled as a single-server queue with infinite capacity and FIFO service method, given a list of customer arrival time a and corresponding service time s, please write a MATLAB program to determine:
*  delay time d, wait time w, and departure time c.
*  average inter-arrival time rbar and average service time sbar
*  average delay dbar, average service sbar, and average wait wbar
*  time averaged number of jobs in the node (lbar), in the queue (qbar), and in service (xbar)

Please use the example input data from attachment (i.e., arrival time a and service time s, from example 1.2.2,  page 16) to evaluate your program, please also see example results in 1.2.2-1.2.5.
  
Copy your program and evaluate results to a word file, and submit that word file to the Assignments board on/before Sept. 12.

### Note:
I used the Ruby programming language to create this program.

### How to set up? ###

* Install Ruby 2.0
* Dependency - 'Spreadsheet' library
