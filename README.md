Assignment 01 - Single Server Queue 

### What is this repository for? ###

* Assuming that a machine shop is modeled as a single-server queue with infinite capacity and FIFO service method, given a list of customer arrival time a and corresponding service time s, please write a MATLAB program to determine:
  1. delay time d, wait time w, and departure time c.
  2. average inter-arrival time rbar and average service time sbar
  3. average delay dbar, average service sbar, and average wait wbar
  4. time averaged number of jobs in the node (lbar), in the queue (qbar), and in service (xbar)
Please use the example input data from attachment (i.e., arrival time a and service time s, from example 1.2.2,  page 16) to evaluate your program, please also see example results in 1.2.2-1.2.5.
  Copy your program and evaluate results to a word file, and submit that word file to the Assignments board on/before Sept. 12.
